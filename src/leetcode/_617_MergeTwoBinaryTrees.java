 * <p>
 * Given two binary trees and imagine that when you put one of them to cover the other,
 * some nodes of the two trees are overlapped while the others are not.
 * <p>
 * You need to merge them into a new binary tree. The merge rule is that if two nodes overlap,
 * then sum node values up as the new value of the merged node.
 * Otherwise, the NOT null node will be used as the node of new tree.
